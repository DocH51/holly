THOUGHTS = [
    "sometimes. the human presses their noggin against mine. to figure out what i’m thinking. so i just think really hard. about how much i love them. and hope they figure it out",
    "SOMEONE LEFT A FULL PLATE OF COOKIES. AND A GLASS OF MILK. RIGHT BY THE FIREPLACE FOR ME. I AM NOT KIDDING. WHAT A NIGHT",
    "i had a long talk. with my fren. about how to spot. a fake ball throw. the optimal strategy. is to follow the ball. with your eyes. instead of your heart",
    "i forgot to tell the human. what i wanted for christmas. but that’s okay. it’s hard to wrap a hug",
    "the human is fast asleep. but i jumped on their bed. and cuddled close. to remind them that i love them. because the nighttime is long. and i’m worried they might forget",
    "occasionally. the freezer will provide crunch water. this is way better than regular water. because of the crunch",
    "gooooob morning. i helped walk the small neighbor human. to the bus at the end of the street. i tried to get on with them. but was quickly denied. they know that with an education. i’d be too powerful",
    "every time i get brushed. i have to take my collar off. the human always laughs. and says that i’m naked. but joke’s on them. i’m very confident in my body",
    "on our walk today. i tried to say hello to a person passing by. but they backed away. and continued on. without so much as a smile. the human later explained. that not everyone is going to like me. and i need to be okay with that. but here’s the thing.. i’m not okay with that",
    "THE HUMAN JUST GRABBED THEIR KEYS. AND MY LEASH. THEY ARE PUTTING ON. THEIR OUTSIDE FEET. I DO BELIEVE. IT IS ADVENTURE TIME",
    "if you start leaving the house again. who will be around to say. ohhh big stretch. every time i do a stretch",
    "there are many humans in the household right now. and they all seem to have snacks. so i’m going to convince each and every one of them. that i have not eaten. in several weeks",
    "surround yourself. with those who would flip your ear back for you. if it ever went inside out",
    "personally. i don’t think you should set off fireworks. for any reason ever",
    "the human seems distracted. so i put my paw on their knee. and now they know. that whatever it is. we’re in it together",
    "nobody ever told me. when you wake up from a nap. you can immediately start another one. that was something i figured out. all by myself",
    "i know there’s bad in the world. and it would be silly. to pretend it isn’t there. but for now here’s my leash. and a few licks on your hand. to convince you that one day. we will be alright",
    "sometimes. the human needs a break from the world. so i grab my leash. drop it in their hand. and we take a walk. where all we have to focus on. is putting one paw in front of the other",
    "i was told. whenever a square car with sirens passes by. they are on their way to help. so i always howl along. to let everyone know. i’m helping too",
    """i would like more frens. so i have made a list of my best qualities. for your consideration

    1. can jump (and sit)
    C. sometimes i sneeze

    i look forward. to hearing from you"""
    "sometimes. i'll lean against your leg. and it's not because. i'm afraid to lose my balance. it's just that. i'm afraid to lose you",
    "i had been asleep several hours. when the human decided to wake me up with a hug. that’s no problem. it’s what i’m here for",
    "i found a really good stick. but i chewed it too hard. and it broke in half. which was disappointing until i realized. now i have two sticks. today has been. an emotional roller coaster",
    "gooooob morning. i’m being told. someone came down the chimney last night. this is preposterous. i would’ve lost my mind",
    "gooooob morning. the human made me a pancake. in the shape of a heart. it tasted similar to a circle pancake. but meant a lot more",
    "WE ARE AT THE PARK. BUT THE HUMAN SAYS IT’S TIME TO LEAVE. WHICH DOESN’T MAKE SENSE. BECAUSE THEY CAN’T CATCH ME",
    "the human hasn’t smiled much today. and i’m not sure why. but i have a squeaker toy that looks like a cupcake. and i am coming. to the rescue",
    "i hear a noise. i think it’s the garaGE DOOR. IT IS THE GARAGE DOOR. THE HUMAN IS HOME. AND MY FEETS. THEY ARE A TIPPY TAPPIN",
    "do not start. with those sky booms. i don’t like them. and you don’t deserve them",
    "the human went out. to have fun with some frens. they promised they’d be back soon. so i’m not worried at all. and in the meantime. i found an old jacket. that smells like they’re still here. it will be my new bed. until they return",
    "gooooob morning. i’m going to need a lot of attention today. i can just tell",
    "i will love you. for all eternity. and in return. could you please wipe away my eye boogers",
    "i decided that today. is bring your human to work day. we stared out the window for hours. and they helped me spot the cars. it was magical",
    "i worked. so. hard. to get the squeaker out of that toy. and you just. threw it away",
    "sometimes. i’ll pretend i need to tell you a secret. but when you lean in close. i’ll lick your ear instead. i am a master of deception",
    "i went outside one more time before bed. the human kept calling me. but the stars look so nice right now. if i sit and enjoy them long enough. the human will have no choice. but to come out. and enjoy them with me",
    "my ball rolled under the couch. and i cannot reach it. the human has been informed of the issue. and reminded. that my problems. are their problems",

    "i may have gotten bigger. but my desire to be held. has remained constant",
    "WE’RE GOING ON A HIKE. AND I’M CARRYING MY TRAVEL BOWL. IN CASE OF THIRST. BUT I HAVE To keep stopping. and looking back. because the human is slow. and i am speedy",
    "gooooob morning. i know you’ve got a lot going on right now. so i wanted to mention. i think you’re doing great",
    "the human said. they might make pancakes in the morning. so the faster i fall asleep. the sooner i get a pancake. as you can imagine. it’s hard to snoozle. under so much pressure",
    "gooooob morning. the first time you wake up. could be a mistake. it’s best to fall back to sleep. just to be safe",
    "the human keeps a picture of me. on the front of their little computer. so they can show everyone they meet. wherever they go. just how beautiful i am",
    "WE ARE GOING TO THE BEACH. I CAN SMELL THE OCEAN. I’M GOING TO EAT THE SAND",
